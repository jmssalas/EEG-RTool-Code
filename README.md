# EEG RTool Code
EEG RTool is my End-of-Degree project and is a web tool for EEG signals processing. This repository contains the code of this web tool and a example data to test the web tool. The repository contains the following files:

- `main.R`. It is the web tool's main file. Source this file to run the web tool.
- `data/`. This folder contains the example data.
- `scripts/`. This folder contains the used scripts by the web tool.
- `server/`. This folder contains the files of the Shiny app. Also, it contains a folder (`modules/`) which contains the modules of the Shiny app.
